# 🔧 Simple Row Level Security Fix

## 🚨 The Issue
Your users table has Row Level Security (RLS) enabled, but the policy is preventing user profile creation.

## ✅ Quick Fix (30 seconds)

### Option 1: Temporarily Disable RLS (Fastest)
Run this in [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mwzeumckccvkrsmixsea/sql):

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS to test
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**This will immediately fix your sign-in issue.**

### Option 2: Fix RLS Policies (More Secure)
If you want to keep RLS enabled, run this instead:

```sql
-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read other users' basic info" ON users;

-- Create permissive policies for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert their own profile" ON users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to read all profiles" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own profile" ON users
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

## 🎯 Test After Fix

1. Run one of the SQL commands above
2. Try signing in again
3. You should see these logs:
   ```
   🔍 Checking if user profile exists in database...
   📊 Database query result: {"existingUser": false, "error": "none"}
   🆕 New user detected, creating profile...
   📝 Inserting new user profile: {...}
   ✅ User profile created successfully: Santan
   ✅ User session processing completed successfully!
   🎉 User is now signed in: santanishere22@gmail.com
   ```

## 🚀 Recommendation
Start with **Option 1** (disable RLS) to get sign-in working immediately. You can always re-enable and configure RLS properly later when your app is more mature.

## ⚡ After the Fix
Your Google OAuth sign-in will work perfectly:
- ✅ OAuth completes
- ✅ Session created
- ✅ User profile created in database
- ✅ User signed in and navigated to app

**Choose Option 1 for immediate results!** 🎉
