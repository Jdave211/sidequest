# Supabase Authentication Setup for Mobile OAuth

## üîß Configure Redirect URLs in Supabase

You need to add these redirect URLs in your Supabase dashboard for Google OAuth to work:

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mwzeumckccvkrsmixsea
- Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**

### 2. Add Site URLs
Add these URLs in the **Site URL** field:
```
sidequest://auth/callback
```

### 3. Add Redirect URLs
Add these URLs in the **Redirect URLs** field:
```
sidequest://auth/callback
exp://localhost:8081/--/auth/callback
exp://100.64.128.217:8081/--/auth/callback
exp://192.168.*:8081/--/auth/callback
http://localhost:8081/auth/callback
```

## üîç Why these URLs?

- `sidequest://auth/callback` - For production app with custom scheme
- `exp://localhost:8081/--/auth/callback` - For Expo Go development on localhost
- `exp://100.64.128.217:8081/--/auth/callback` - For your specific development IP
- `exp://192.168.*:8081/--/auth/callback` - For Expo Go development on local network
- `http://localhost:8081/auth/callback` - For web development

## üö® IMPORTANT: Add Your Exact IP

From your logs, I can see your development server is running at:
**`exp://100.64.128.217:8081/--/auth/callback`**

Make sure to add this EXACT URL to your Supabase redirect URLs!

## ‚úÖ Steps to Fix:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration
2. **Add this exact URL** to Redirect URLs:
   ```
   exp://100.64.128.217:8081/--/auth/callback
   ```
3. **Save the configuration**
4. **Test Google sign-in again**

## üéØ What Should Happen:

1. Click "Sign in with Google" ‚úÖ (working)
2. OAuth URL generated ‚úÖ (working)
3. Browser opens Google auth ‚úÖ (should work)
4. After auth, redirects to your app ‚úÖ (will work after URL config)
5. App completes sign-in process ‚úÖ

The OAuth flow is working correctly - you just need to add the exact redirect URL to Supabase! üöÄ
